When looking at both programs it is very easy to see that there are many differences between c++ and python. 

The biggest visual difference that most see is that python does not require types to be explicitly stated when creating variables. This is because python is a dynamically type language. C++, in contrast, is a statically typed language, and requires programmers to explicitly state the data type of variables when they are declared.
This difference is shown on line 7 in the python file and line 16 in the c++ file. Both programs declare a variable named "userInput" that will hold the string input from the user. C++ requires "string" to be present before the variable declaration, while python does not.

This brings us to our next difference; c++ is a pre-compiled language, while python runs through an interpreter. This means that statements in python are executed line by line during run time. With c++, however, the entire program is compiled and then made into an executable file which can then be ran. When compiled, the c++ code is translated into machine code which is understood by the cpu.
